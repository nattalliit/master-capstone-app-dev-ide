# MASTER THESIS

## Topic
**Development of data storage and processing system of multi-user note-taking application in integrated development environments**

## RELEVANCE
An analysis of the actual problems of developing a high-quality application system was carried out to improve the quality of both the program code itself and the functional purpose of the program. The task was set to build a distributed performance testing system with a centralized system for collecting and analyzing results to analyze modern application development solutions in an integrated development environment (IDE) in Java / Swift. The goal was to build a system that would allow distribution and, at the same time, sufficiently large load testing. A productive system based on mobile applications has a prominent place among modern software solutions on the programming market. Well-structured, high-quality software code with integration to web browsers, which can be implemented thanks to OpenShift, is important. Kubernetes has the ability to build such a distributed infrastructure that can be tested for performance. The above makes it possible to develop high-quality software code with modern integration of cloud environment technologies.

## TASK
- Investigate the available software tools, suitable aspects, and types of architecture varieties to build the described system with variations of Kubernetes architectural solutions for perfect deployment of applications.
- Propose a detailed practical system based on the performed analysis, which will serve as a basis for building and testing a prototype performance testing system.

## Purpose, Object, Subject of Research
### Research Goal
To build a distributed performance testing system with a centralized system for collecting and analyzing results to analyze modern application development solutions in an integrated development environment (IDE) in Java / Swift.

### Research Object
Architectures, tools, and approaches to building performance testing systems, unit testing, performance improvement. In particular, Kubernetes as a tool that will make it possible to build a distributed infrastructure for the implementation of such a load.

### Research Subject
Prototype and its testing for performance testing of software code in a web browser with centralized reporting and integration into a CI/CD system.

## CONCLUSIONS
- Investigated the characteristic features of integrated development environments (IDEs) for the system for storing and processing data of a multi-user application for notes.
- Implemented performance improvements in the system for storing and processing data of a multi-user application for notes in integrated development environments (IDE).
- Improved Java/Swift application code performance taking into account Robert Martin's "Clean Code" rules.
- Worked out the requirements for software development according to the "Application Performance Guide" of Android Studio IDE Developers to improve the performance of Java application code.
- Improved the performance of the Java application code, taking into account the security recommendations for the software.
- Integrated into the CI/CD system using OpenShift and Tekton.
